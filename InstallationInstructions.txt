Installation-Checklist
1. Install Matlab
2. Install the Chrome-Extension: Can be downloaded from the repository
3. Instanll JAVA7. You can download it from

JDK For Develpers
JRE For General Users

4. Someother issues: 
1) to ensure this package works fine with your local environment. Please use screen resolution(will effect the resolutions of images captured from game window) 
 between 1024 * 768 and 1920 * 1080. Actually, only 1024 * 768 and 1920 * 1080 have been tested. 
2) Since  the centrod of the bird on the slingshot (we call it focus point) is required when the robot shooting a bird,please specified adjust it manually in Setup.ini. 
To get a accurate focus point: open a game window, load naive agent once, and go to \vision2.3\matlab\im.png  The screen shot of the game window 
is stored in im.png and you can manually get the focus point using paint...

3)  To test the naive agent, you can either type : java -jar Simulator.jar -naive [num] or go to the IntegeratedBangBangBang class to run the method there
[num] specifies the number of segmentations the agent will perform.  The naive agent will shoot birds to the set of pigs dectected by segementation. 

4) All the tracjectory predictions are on the basis of the trajectory points we collect. All the collected trajectory points will be stored in a file. The trajectory
prediction module will make use of that. To collect trajectories, please refer to TrajectoryCollector calss under representation.uitl package
